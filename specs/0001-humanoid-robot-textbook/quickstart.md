# Quickstart: Comprehensive Physical AI Textbook

**Feature Branch**: `001-humanoid-robot-textbook`  
**Created**: 2025-12-14  

This quickstart guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment and viewing the textbook locally.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version, e.g., 18.x)
*   npm or Yarn (preferred)
*   Python 3.10+
*   Docker (for environment consistency)

## Setup

    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Install Docusaurus Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```
    This will open a new browser window to `http://localhost:3000` (or similar).

## Code Examples and Simulations

Each module will provide specific instructions for setting up its corresponding development environment (e.g., ROS 2, Isaac Sim, Gazebo) and running code examples or simulations. Refer to the respective chapter for detailed setup guides.
